# Tokenizer-Lab

  A lab for my Principles of Programming Languages class. The purpose of this lab was to make a lexical analyzer program that read through a file containing code, dividing the code into single tokens, and organizing the tokens into different token categories. The program will return an XML file listing every token and its category in order. The categories that the tokens could be organized into are symbols, integer constants, string constants, reserved words, and identifiers.

## Tokenizer program
The program has three parts: reading the file, separating the code into tokens, and categorizing the tokens. 

### 1. Read file
